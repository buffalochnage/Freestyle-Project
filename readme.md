# Client-side Freestyle Project 

## Locate Anywhere on the Earth

This is a responsive client-side web application that displays an interactive map using Leaflet.js and integrates the GeoNames API and OpenStreetMap Nominatim to search for global locations. The app includes features such as a search bar, recent search history, a loading spinner, and a "Surprise Me!" button for discovering random places.
